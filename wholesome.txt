We're bringing genocide now To the black crowd White man stand proud The superior race Will always run this place  The minorities can't face the Moonman I'm too damn cold Ain't shit, you can pull a stream roller Roll any colored asshole With a noose as my task to hold New recruits enrol to the triple K To slay a nigga everyday To being white, it's great Thats why I spread the hate to those Who oppose the white race  The end of a barrel is what a black takes I'm encased with enough rage To engage with the 12 gauge  Yo, this is Moonman sending you out With an outro Triple K mafia in this hoe Just know If it ain't white It ain't right KKK
